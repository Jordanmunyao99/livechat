This is a vibe coded auto typing test made in my spare time to give prompting a try.

Requirements:
python 3
  pynput 
  selenium
Chrome 

Method of use:
1.Launch in the vs terminal after setting up a virtual environmemt.
2.This will open a separate chrome window(You can edit if you want a normal window or incognito in chrome_options)
3.Wait till it loads( it'll say ready in the terminal)
4.Enter the shft key and let the script do its job till completion

Notes to add:
You can change the typing speed by varying time.sleep(random.uniform()) on line 199.
The smaller te range and size of the number the faster the tying speed
You can also vary time.sleep()on line 205
The auto typer works at around 38 wp to 56 wpm but is motly above 40wpm
